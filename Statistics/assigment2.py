"""
ASSIGNMENT (CONFIDENCE INTERVALS) 

EXERCISE 1. 
Suppose scores on exams in statistics are normally distributed with an unknown
 population mean and a population standard deviation of 3 points.
 A random sample of 36 scores is taken and gives a sample mean
 (sample  mean score) of 68. Find a confidence interval estimate 
 for the population mean exam score (the mean score on all exams).
Find a 90% confidence interval for the true (population) mean of statistics exam scores. 

 Confidence Interval = (x̄ – z * ơ / √n) to(x̄ + z * ơ / √n)


n = 36  confidence interval=(68-(1/2)(1.6449), 68+(1/2)(1.6449)= ( 67.18, 68.82)




EXERCISE 2. 
What is the normal body temperature for healthy humans? 
A random sample of 130 healthy human body temperatures 
provided by Allen Shoemaker7 yielded 98.25 degrees and standard deviation 0.73 degrees. 
Give a 99% confidence interval for the average body temperature of healthy people.

 n=130
 x̄=98.25
 ơ=0.73
 a=0.01  (2.576)
 Confidence Interval = (x̄ – z * ơ / √n) to(x̄ + z * ơ / √n)
 
 =(98.25-2.576*0.73/√130) to (98.25+2.576*0.73/√130)
 =(98.086,98.414)




EXERCISE 3. 
The administrators for a hospital wished to estimate the average number of
 days required for inpatient treatment of patients between the ages of 25 
 and 34. A random sample of 500 hospital patients between these ages 
 produced a mean and standard deviation equal to 5.4 and 3.1 days, respectively.
Construct a 95% confidence interval for the mean length of stay 
for the population of patients from which the sample was drawn.
 
 n=500
 x̄=5.4
 ơ=3.1
 a=0.05  (1.96)

Confidence Interval = (x̄ – z * ơ / √n) to(x̄ + z * ơ / √n)

=(5.14-1.96*3.1/√500) to (5.14+1.96*3.1/√500) =(5.1,5.7)
